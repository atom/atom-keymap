# Extended: Allows commands to be associated with keystrokes in a
# context-sensitive way. In Atom, you can access a global instance of this
# object via `atom.keymap`.
#
# Key bindings are plain JavaScript objects containing **CSS selectors** as
# their top level keys, then **keystroke patterns** mapped to commands.
#
# ```cson
# '.workspace':
#   'ctrl-l': 'package:do-something'
#   'ctrl-z': 'package:do-something-else'
# '.mini.editor':
#   'enter': 'core:confirm'
# ```
#
# When a keystroke sequence matches a binding in a given context, a custom DOM
# event with a type based on the command is dispatched on the target of the
# keyboard event.
#
# To match a keystroke sequence, the keymap starts at the target element for the
# keyboard event. It looks for key bindings associated with selectors that match
# the target element. If multiple match, the most specific is selected. If there
# is a tie in specificity, the most recently added binding wins. If no bindings
# are found for the events target, the search is repeated again for the target's
# parent node and so on recursively until a binding is found or we traverse off
# the top of the document.
#
# When a binding is found, its command event is always dispatched on the
# original target of the keyboard event, even if the matching element is higher
# up in the DOM. In addition, `.preventDefault()` is called on the keyboard
# event to prevent the browser from taking action. `.preventDefault` is only
# called if a matching binding is found.
#
# Command event objects have a non-standard method called `.abortKeyBinding()`.
# If your command handler is invoked but you programmatically determine that no
# action can be taken and you want to allow other bindings to be matched, call
# `.abortKeyBinding()` on the event object. An example of where this is useful
# is binding snippet expansion to `tab`. If `snippets:expand` is invoked when
# the cursor does not follow a valid snippet prefix, we abort the binding and
# allow `tab` to be handled by the default handler, which inserts whitespace.
#
# Multi-keystroke bindings are possible. If a sequence of one or more keystrokes
# *partially* matches a multi-keystroke binding, the keymap enters a pending
# state. The pending state is terminated on the next keystroke, or after
# {::partialMatchTimeout} milliseconds has elapsed. When the pending state is
# terminated via a timeout or a keystroke that leads to no matches, the longest
# ambiguous bindings that caused the pending state are temporarily disabled and
# the previous keystrokes are replayed. If there is ambiguity again during the
# replay, the next longest bindings are disabled and the keystrokes are replayed
# again.
