# Extended: Allows commands to be associated with keystrokes in a
# context-sensitive way. In Atom, you can access a global instance of this
# object via `atom.keymaps`.
#
# Key bindings are plain JavaScript objects containing **CSS selectors** as
# their top level keys, then **keystroke patterns** mapped to commands.
#
# ```cson
# '.workspace':
#   'ctrl-l': 'package:do-something'
#   'ctrl-z': 'package:do-something-else'
# '.mini.editor':
#   'enter': 'core:confirm'
# ```
#
# When a keystroke sequence matches a binding in a given context, a custom DOM
# event with a type based on the command is dispatched on the target of the
# keyboard event.
#
# To match a keystroke sequence, the keymap starts at the target element for the
# keyboard event. It looks for key bindings associated with selectors that match
# the target element. If multiple match, the most specific is selected. If there
# is a tie in specificity, the most recently added binding wins. If no bindings
# are found for the events target, the search is repeated again for the target's
# parent node and so on recursively until a binding is found or we traverse off
# the top of the document.
#
# When a binding is found, its command event is always dispatched on the
# original target of the keyboard event, even if the matching element is higher
# up in the DOM. In addition, `.preventDefault()` is called on the keyboard
# event to prevent the browser from taking action. `.preventDefault` is only
# called if a matching binding is found.
#
# Command event objects have a non-standard method called `.abortKeyBinding()`.
# If your command handler is invoked but you programmatically determine that no
# action can be taken and you want to allow other bindings to be matched, call
# `.abortKeyBinding()` on the event object. An example of where this is useful
# is binding snippet expansion to `tab`. If `snippets:expand` is invoked when
# the cursor does not follow a valid snippet prefix, we abort the binding and
# allow `tab` to be handled by the default handler, which inserts whitespace.
#
# Multi-keystroke bindings are possible. If a sequence of one or more keystrokes
# *partially* matches a multi-keystroke binding, the keymap enters a pending
# state. The pending state is terminated on the next keystroke, or after
# {::partialMatchTimeout} milliseconds has elapsed. When the pending state is
# terminated via a timeout or a keystroke that leads to no matches, the longest
# ambiguous bindings that caused the pending state are temporarily disabled and
# the previous keystrokes are replayed. If there is ambiguity again during the
# replay, the next longest bindings are disabled and the keystrokes are replayed
# again.

  # ancestors, `.preventDefault()` is called on the keyboard event and the
  # binding's command is emitted as a custom event on the matching element.
  #
  # If the matching binding's command is 'native!', the method will terminate
  # without calling `.preventDefault()` on the keyboard event, allowing the
  # browser to handle it as normal.
  #

  # the current element's parent.
  #
  # If the matching binding's command is 'abort!', the search will terminate
  # without dispatching a command event.
  #
  # If the event's target is `document.body`, it will be treated as if its
  # target is `.defaultTarget` if that property is assigned on the keymap.
  #
  # * `event` A `KeyboardEvent` of type 'keydown'
  handleKeyboardEvent: (event, {replay, disabledBindings}={}) ->
    # Handling keyboard events is complicated and very nuanced. The complexity
    # is all due to supporting multi-stroke bindings. An example binding we'll
    # use throughout this very long comment:
    #
    # 'ctrl-a b c': 'my-sweet-command' // This is a binding
    #
    # This example means the user can type `ctrl-a` then `b` then `c`, and after
    # all of those keys are typed, it will dispatch the `my-sweet-command`
    # command.
    #
    # The KeymapManager has a couple member variables to deal with multi-stroke
    # bindings: `@queuedKeystrokes` and `@queuedKeyboardEvents`. They keep track
    # of the keystrokes the user has typed. When populated, the state variables
    # look something like:
    #
    # @queuedKeystrokes = ['ctrl-a', 'b', 'c']
    # @queuedKeyboardEvents = [KeyboardEvent, KeyboardEvent, KeyboardEvent]
    #
    # Basically, this `handleKeyboardEvent` function will try to exactly match
    # the user's keystrokes to a binding. If it cant match exactly, it looks for
    # partial matches. So say, a user typed `ctrl-a` then `b`, but not `c` yet.
    # The `ctrl-a b c` binding would be partially matched:
    #
    # // The original binding: 'ctrl-a b c': 'my-sweet-command'
    # @queuedKeystrokes = ['ctrl-a', 'b'] // The user's keystrokes
    # @queuedKeyboardEvents = [KeyboardEvent, KeyboardEvent]
    #
    # When it finds partially matching bindings, it will put the KeymapManager
    # into a pending state via `enterPendingState` indicating that it is waiting
    # for either a timeout or more keystrokes to exactly match the partial
    # matches. In our example, it is waiting for the user to type `c` to
    # complete the partially matched `ctrl-a b c` binding.
    #
    # If a keystroke comes in that either matches a binding exactly, or yields
    # no partial matches, we will reset the state variables and exit pending
    # mode. If the keystroke yields no partial matches we will call
    # `terminatePendingState`. An extension of our last example:
    #
    # // Both of these will exit pending state for: 'ctrl-a b c': 'my-sweet-command'
    # @queuedKeystrokes = ['ctrl-a', 'b', 'c'] // User typed `c`. Exact match! Dispatch the command and clear state variables. Easy.
    # @queuedKeystrokes = ['ctrl-a', 'b', 'd'] // User typed `d`. No hope of matching, terminatePendingState(). Dragons.
    #
    # `terminatePendingState` is where things get crazy. Let's pretend the user
    # typed 3 total keystrokes: `ctrl-a`, `b`, then `d`. There are no exact
    # matches with these keystrokes given the original `'ctrl-a b c'` binding,
    # but other bindings might match a subset of the user's typed keystrokes.
    # Let's pretend we had more bindings defined:
    #
    # // The original binding; no match for ['ctrl-a', 'b', 'd']:
    # 'ctrl-a b c': 'my-sweet-command'
    #
    # // Bindings that all match a subset of ['ctrl-a', 'b', 'd']:
    # 'ctrl-a': 'ctrl-a-command'
    # 'b d': 'do-a-bd-deal'
    # 'd o g': 'wag-the-dog'
    #
    # With these example bindings, and the user's `['ctrl-a', 'b', 'd']`
    # keystrokes, we should dispatch commands `ctrl-a-command` and
    # `do-a-bd-deal`.
    #
    # After `['ctrl-a', 'b', 'd']` is typed by the user, `terminatePendingState`
    # is called, which will _disable_ the original unmatched `ctrl-a b c`
    # binding, empty the keystroke state variables, and _replay_ the key events
    # by running them through this `handleKeyboardEvent` function again. The
    # replay acts exactly as if a user were typing the keys, but with a disabled
    # binding. Because the original binding is disabled, the replayed keystrokes
    # will match other, shorter bindings, and in this case, dispatch commands
    # for our `ctrl-a` and then our `b d` bindings.
    #
    # Because the replay is calling this `handleKeyboardEvent` function again,
    # it can get into another pending state, and again call
    # `terminatePendingState`. The 2nd call to `terminatePendingState` might
    # disable other bindings, and do another replay, which might call this
    # function again ... and on and on. It will recurse until the KeymapManager
    # is no longer in a pending state with no partial matches from the most
